        <h2>Made to be Modded</h2>
        <p>
            The game is built with modding in mind!
            Not only do you have open source access to <a href="https://github.com/rukai/canon_collision">the entire rust source code</a>.
            But the game also has powerful built-in tools, allowing you to create your own characters and stages without writing a single line of code.
        </p>
        <h2>Download</h2>
        <p>
            You can download the <a href="/builds">latest build here</a>.
            Currently you need a gamecube to wii u adapter or an xbox controller to play.
